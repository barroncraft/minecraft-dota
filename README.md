Minecraft Dota
==============

Moba style game similar to [LOL](leagueoflegends.com) and [DOTA](http://www.playdota.com/) built in Minecraft.

Installing
----------

For large servers, we recommend using our [automated installer](https://github.com/barroncraft/barroncraft-puppet) (supports Debian 7 and CentOS 6)

    wget -qO- http://barron.nu/install | sh

You can also find pre-packaged configurations on the [releases](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/releases) page.  Just download and run `server.sh` on Linux/Mac or `server.bat` on Windows.  There's also a [guide on Barron Wiki](http://wiki.barroncraft.com/wiki/Hosting_Minecraft_Dota) on how to manually configure a server.
